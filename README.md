## Grafana Dashboards

Some [Grafana][] dashboards are included in the `dashboards` folder. Simply
import them and make sure you have your Prometheus data source named to
`cluster-prometheus`.

## Usage

First, clone the repo into your `$GOPATH`.

```sh
mkdir -p "$GOPATH/src/github.com/gardener"
git clone https://github.com/gardener/gardener-metrics-exporter.git \
          "$GOPATH/src/github.com/gardener/gardener-metrics-exporter"

cd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/gardener/gardener-metrics-exporter"
```

### Local

The metrics exporter needs to run against a Gardener environment (Kubernetes
cluster extendend with `core.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1` api group). Such an
environment can be created by following the instructions the [gardener local
setup][].

If the current-context of your `$HOME/.kube/config` point to a Gardener
environment then you can simply run:

```sh
make start
```

If you plan to pass a specific kubeconfig then you need to build the app locally
and pass a kubeconfig to the binary. Let's build the app for your environment
locally and run it. The binary will be located in the `./bin` directory of the
repository.

```sh
# Build
make build-local

# Run
./bin/gardener-metrics-exporter --kubeconfig=<path-to-kubeconfig-file>
```

**Be aware:** The user in the kubeconfig needs permissions to ``GET, LIST,
*WATCH`` the resources ``Shoot, Seed, Project
*(core.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1)`` in all namespaces of the cluster.

Verify that everything works by calling the `/metrics` endpoint of the app.

```sh
curl http://localhost:2718/metrics
```

Run a local [Prometheus][] instance and add the following scrape config snippet
to your config.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'gardener-metrics-exporter'
  static_configs:
    - targets:
      - localhost:2718
  metric_relabel_configs:
   - source_labels: [ __name__ ]
     regex: '^garden_.*$'
     action: keep
```

Now the metrics should be collected by Prometheus. Open the Prometheus console
and query for ``garden_*`` metrics.

### In Cluster

Deploy the metrics-exporter to a kubernetes cluster via helm.

```sh
helm upgrade gardener-metrics-exporter charts/gardener-metrics-exporter \
     --install --namespace=<your-namespace> --values=<path-to-your-values.yaml>
```

For example, the scrape config for your Prometheus could look like this:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'gardener-metrics-exporter'
  kubernetes_sd_configs:
  - role: endpoints
    namespaces:
      names:
      - <helm-deployment-namespace>
  relabel_configs:
  - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name]
    regex: gardener-metrics-exporter
    action: keep
  metric_relabel_configs:
   - source_labels: [ __name__ ]
     regex: '^garden_.*$'
     action: keep
```
